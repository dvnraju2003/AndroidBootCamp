Implemented the Grid Image View Search.

The functionality and working can be found in:gridimagesearch.gif

Used google image search api to get the results.

Used smartimageview library for displaying an image.

Used libraries like android async http for asynchronous http requests.

The obtained results in json format are parsed and stored in grid view.

Used a third party class called Endlessscrolllistener for pagination.

Implemented action bar settings which used spinners in their views.

The url request has several parameters like size,color,sitefilter and image type
which are obtained the results of settings which are saved from the action bar above.

The sharing of data from one view to the other is done by the concept called "intents".

A click on the image makes it open in a new window and it can shared using the "mail"
symbol in the action bar.
